# juliasignalweaver
Signalweaver's analytic part rewritten in julia. In this way I can go all out and use more fancy (usually simpler at the same time) algorithms suited to the problem. 

The current functionality is extracting templates from biological signals - could be any signal, as long as it is biological, i.e. starts low, increases amplitude, and ends low.
